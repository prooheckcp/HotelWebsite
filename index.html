            <p>
                Boo got into this business very early into his life. He learned that the best way to keep chamusca away from him was to keep her busy with the guests! In order to achieve this he had the brilliant idea to charge people to live in the same house as him. In this way he is capable of not only being paid in the nicest wet food in the whole neigherhood as well as keeping her biggest enemy away.
